  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>800g beef ribs</li>
    <li>2 tbsp roasted sesame oil</li>
    <li>3 tbsp honey</li>
    <li>1/2 onion</li>
    <li>90g Korean chives</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Method</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Put the ribs in a deep baking tray. Fill with enough water to submerge them, cover, then soak for 30–45 minutes, changing the water once or twice. Drain.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, put all the remaining ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth. Put the soaked ribs and marinade in a baking tray or wide, flat bowl. Using your hands, massage the sauce into the meat. Cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
    <li>If cooking on the hob, put a heavy griddle pan over a medium-high heat. When hot, add the ribs to the pan in batches and cook for 6 minutes on each side.</li>
    <li>If barbecuing, place the grill 12–15cm/5–6in above the flame. Cook the ribs for 6 minutes on each side, turning every now and again to cook them evenly, until they are caramel-brown and slightly charred in places.</li>
    <li>Once cooked, use a pair of scissors to cut off the strip of bones and discard, then snip the meat into bite-size pieces. <i>Serve immediately.</i></li>
  </ol>
